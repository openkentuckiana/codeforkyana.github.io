From 2019 to 2023 Kentuckiana was the official <a href="https://brigade.codeforamerica.org/about">Code for America Brigade</a> for Louisville, Ky. Code for America decided to end its Brigade program in 2023. There were 70+ Brigades across the United States, bringing together community organizers, developers, and designers to use technology to improve the lives of citizens.

Our mission is to <em>organize and advocate for the use of public data and technology to make Louisville and Southern Indiana a more safe, resilient, and equitable place.</em>
