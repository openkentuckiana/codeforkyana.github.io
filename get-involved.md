<p>Open Kentuckiana was formed to bring people together to make Kentuckiana a better place. Our mission is <em>To organize and advocate for the use of public data and technology to make Louisville and Southern Indiana a more safe, resilient, and equitable place.</em></p>

<p>To make that happen, we need <strong>projects</strong> and <strong>volunteers</strong>. You can see some of the <a href="../projects/">projects</a> we're planning to work on, but the most impactful projects will come from our community. We need you to join us in making things better. If you have a project idea or you want to work on a project you see here, please reach out, we would love your help.</p>
